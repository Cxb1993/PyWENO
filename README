Installing PyWENO

PyWENO uses the 'setuptools' package to automate building and
installing PyWENO.  Once you have installed setuptools, you can
install PyWENO by running:

# python setup.py install

If you plan on modifying PyWENO you can install PyWENO into your
PYHTONPATH in development mode by running, eg,

$ python setup.py develop -d ~/opt/python
$ export PYTHONPATH=~/opt/python:$PYTHONPATH
