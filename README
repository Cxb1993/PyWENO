PyWENO
======

PyWENO is a Python implementation of one-dimensional Weighted
Essentially Non-oscillatory (WENO) approximations over non-uniform
grids.

for more information.


Prerequisites
-------------

To install PyWENO, you need:

  * NumPy
  * SciPy
  * H5PY
  * SymPy    (optional if you avoid pyweno.symbolic)
  * PyOpenCL (optional if you avoid pyweno.opencl)

Many distributions include packaged versions of these Python modules.
If you are running Debian or Ubuntu, you can install the prerequisites
(except PyOpenCL), the Python development files, and setuptools
(required in order to build PyWENO) by running:

$ sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-sympy python-h5py python-setuptools python-dev


Installing PyWENO
-----------------

PyWENO uses the 'setuptools' package to automate building and
installing PyWENO.  Once you have installed setuptools, you can
install PyWENO by running:

$ sudo python setup.py install

If you plan on modifying PyWENO you can install PyWENO into your
PYHTONPATH in development mode by running, eg,

$ export PYTHONPATH=~/opt/python:$PYTHONPATH
$ python setup.py develop -d ~/opt/python
