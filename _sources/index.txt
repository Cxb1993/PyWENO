PyWENO
======

PyWENO is a Python implementation of one-dimensional Weighted
Essentially Non-oscillatory (WENO) approximations over unstructured
(non-uniform) grids.

Please see Matthew's :download:`WENO <WENO.pdf>` document for the
mathematics behind PyWENO.

Check out some :doc:`examples <examples>` to learn more about what
PyWENO is all about.

Obtaining PyWENO
----------------

Download, build, and install from source.  The latest source
distribution is available in either
`zip <http://github.com/memmett/PyWENO/zipball/master>`_ or
`tar <http://github.com/memmett/PyWENO/tarball/master>`_ format.

PyWENO uses the Python
`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
package for installation.  Once this is installed, the following is
helpful::

  $ python setup.py develop -d <your python path>

You can also obtain the source code on GitHub through the `PyWENO
project page <http://github.com/memmett/PyWENO>`_.  You can clone the
project by running::

  $ git clone git://github.com/memmett/PyWENO

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome!  Please send comments, suggestions, and/or
patches to the primary author (Matthew Emmett).  You will be credited.

If you plan to extend or modify PyWENO in a more substantial way,
please let the author know (so that we can create a central
repository).
